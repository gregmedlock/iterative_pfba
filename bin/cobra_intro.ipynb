    "FBA is great for determining optimal growth rates, but there are nearly always an infinite number of solutions (sets of flux values for each reaction in the network) that lead to the same maximal value for the objective (here, flux through the biomass reaction). Flux Variability Analysis (FVA) let's us identify the minimal and maximal flux through individual reactions in the network that still allow an objective value above a specified threshold. In other words, FVA tells us the minimum and maximum flux through a single reaction that allow at least a specified amount of flux through biomass.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use FVA to identify components of the media that must be consumed in order for the model to grow. Let's get the exchange reactions that are in `model.medium` and perform FVA for each reaction. The critical arguments for the FVA function are the model FVA is being performed on, the list of reactions that FVA will be performed on (the process is performed separately for each reaction in the list), and the fraction of the optimum value of the objective that needs to be maintained when manipulating flux through the target reaction (where the target reaction is the reaction being minimized/maximized in FVA). Here, we'll use `fraction_of_optimum = 1.0` to require 100% of the optimum value to be maintained during FVA."

Indexing works the same way--each row can have a name, called the index, and each column can have a name as well. Columns are accessed by their names, but rows have to be accessed with the `.loc` operator to access by their name. (See this extremely thorough tutorial, which I've googled a million times and still use for reference frequently: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html)\n",

    "We'll use some logical operations to extract metabolites for which uptake was required for optimal growth. Remember that uptake into the cell for an exchange reaction means that there was negative flux. If the maximum flux value obtained from FVA is negative, the metabolite was taken up by the model."
